# Awesome SEO MCP Servers [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> Every Model Context Protocol server that connects an AI agent to SEO data. Search Console, keywords, backlinks, crawls, SERPs, and AI search visibility.

Every entry below was checked by hand in September 2026. We record who runs it, how you connect, what authentication it needs, and when it was last touched, because half the SEO MCP servers you find in a search are abandoned or have moved.

---

**Maintained by [RankSpot](https://www.rankspot.ai/)**, an AI search visibility platform that tracks brand mentions in ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Google AI Overviews. RankSpot ships [its own MCP server](https://www.rankspot.ai/) and it is listed below in the same table as every competitor we could find, on the same terms. Spot a mistake in anyone's row? [Open a PR](CONTRIBUTING.md) and we will merge it.

## How to read this list

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Type** | `Remote` means a hosted URL you point your client at, nothing to install. `Local` means it runs on your machine, usually via npx or uvx. |
| **Auth** | What you need to connect. `OAuth` opens a browser login. `API key` needs a key from the vendor. `None` works out of the box. |
| **Stars** | GitHub stars, refreshed weekly by a workflow in this repo. Vendor servers with no public repo show `n/a`. |
| **Updated** | Last push to the default branch. Anything older than a year is worth testing before you rely on it. |

Servers marked **Official** are built and run by the company whose data they expose. Everything else is community built, which is not a knock, some community servers are better maintained than the official ones.

## Official servers

Run by the vendor. These are the ones to reach for first if you already pay for the underlying tool.

## Google Search Console

Google has no official GSC MCP server as of September 2026, so this category is entirely community built. `mcp-gsc` is the de facto standard.

## Archived or superseded

Listed so you stop finding them in search results and wondering why they do not work.

| Server | Status | Use instead |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [ahrefs/ahrefs-mcp-server](https://github.com/ahrefs/ahrefs-mcp-server) | Archived February 2026 | The [official remote server](https://docs.ahrefs.com/docs/mcp/) at `https://api.ahrefs.com/mcp/mcp` |
| [houtini-ai/seo-crawler-mcp](https://github.com/houtini-ai/seo-crawler-mcp) | Archived, merged into a larger tool | [houtini-ai/seo-audit](https://github.com/houtini-ai/seo-audit) |

Two more renames worth knowing, because older lists still point at the dead URLs: `egebese/seo-research-mcp` is now [egebese/dataseo-mcp](https://github.com/egebese/dataseo-mcp), and `semihbugrasezer/etsy-seo-mcp` is now [semihbugrasezer/seerxo](https://github.com/semihbugrasezer/seerxo).

## Connecting a server to your client

**Claude Code, remote server:**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http ahrefs https://api.ahrefs.com/mcp/mcp
```

**Claude Code, local server:**

```bash
claude mcp add gsc -- uvx mcp-gsc
```

**Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf and most other clients** use a JSON config file. Remote servers look like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "semrush": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.semrush.com/claude/v1/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Local servers look like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dataforseo": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "dataforseo-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "DATAFORSEO_USERNAME": "your-username",
        "DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD": "your-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Remote servers using OAuth will open a browser window the first time you connect, then reuse the credentials. Check each repo's README for the exact package name and required environment variables, since they vary.

## Gaps worth filling

Things people keep asking for that nobody has built well yet. Build one and we will list it.

- **Google Search Console, officially.** The most important free data source in SEO still has no first-party server.
- **Log file analysis.** Nothing exposes server logs so an agent can see which bots crawled what.
- **Internal linking.** No server maps internal link graphs or suggests link opportunities at scale.
- **Structured data validation.** Plenty of generators, no server that validates JSON-LD against Google's rich result requirements.
- **Hreflang and international SEO.** Completely unserved.
- **Moz, officially.** Only a community server exists, last updated mid 2025.
- **Content publishing.** WordPress has partial coverage, but nothing CMS-agnostic that handles Webflow, Ghost, Shopify and Framer.

## Contributing

Additions and corrections are welcome, including corrections to entries for tools that compete with RankSpot. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for what an entry needs.

The short version: the server has to actually exist, actually run, and speak MCP. We do not list roadmap announcements, and we do not list plain REST APIs with no MCP interface. Agent Skills go in [awesome-seo-agent-skills](https://github.com/RankSpotAI/awesome-seo-agent-skills) instead.
